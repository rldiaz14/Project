            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Ramon, I am an aspiring AI Engineer with over 3 months of experience in the Video Game Industry.
                I am employed as Game Programmer at Warrior Heart Studio,Concurrently, I am studying Master of  Science
                in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Drexel University, 
                anticipating graduation in 2025. Since childhood, I’ve been enchanted by the world of gaming, which opened 
                the first doors of technology to me. These early encounters ignited a lifelong interest that has done far
                more than provided entertainment. I am member of International Game Developer Association(IGDA), 
                Baltimore Indie GameDevs and I am activate member of this organizations. The fascination shaped my career 
                interest but also has driven me to continuously explore and adopt new skills and technologies relevant to gaming and AI.
            </p>

            <p>
                I bring a wealth of experience from my time at Game Warrior Heart Studio Game Programmer, where I honed my skills in C++, 
                Artificial Intelligence, and Visual Scripting. These roles not only provided me with a solid foundation in the practical 
                application of Artificial Intelligence but also allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the industry’s dynamics and
                the challenges faced by professionals in the field. Also, I have accomplished certification Basic Python from Hacker Rank, 
                ChatGPT chatbot for SalesForce Admin and Development ChatGPT from Udemy, Gaming QA: Basic of testing games from Udemy,
                Leader Certification from The National Leader Association and Success. My hands-on experience, combined with my theoretical knowledge, 
                makes me well-equipped to bring value to any team in the Video Game Industry.
            </p>

            <p> I am on a continuous journey of professional development and learning in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 
                My immediate goal is to secure a position as an AI Engineer, where I can apply and further develop my skills while
                contributing positively to a small tech company. Looking ahead, I envision myself taking a leadership role that allows
                me to drive innovative projects and initiatives, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the industry. My long-term 
                aspirations include not only becoming an expert in my field but also being a mentor and guide for aspiring professionals. 
                Through a combination of practical experience, continuous learning, and collaboration with talented colleagues, I aspire to make
                a significant impact in the Artificial Intelligence field, participating, and eventually leading projects that are both challenging
                and rewarding. </p>
